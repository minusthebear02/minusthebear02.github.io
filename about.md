In a world of automation and consumerism, I prefer to make. The sense of accomplishment brought by building something that you and your peers can enjoy is unlike anything else. For me it started with brewing my own beer and woodworking but when I realized the potential of what I could make computer programming I dove in head first. Being able to develop a web application or website that could potentially be seen and used by millions of people is what has driven me to enter the web development field.

## Where I Came From ##

I grew up in Pennsylvania before moving up to Long Island to attend Hofstra University. While there I took a few elective Computer Science courses but graduated with a degree in Marketing. From there I got a job in sales and, while I love the people I work with and dealing with clients, sales just does not give me that accomplished feeling.

## What I've Done ##

I've spent countless hours on self taught computer programming courses like Codecademy and Khan Academy while also making dummy websites, for instance, for my home brewery Matchstick Brewing Co. But what I'm most proud of is taking the leap toward the full career change by enrolling in a rigorous bootcamp called Bloc. While there I've been firming up my knowledge of HTML and CSS while diving deeper into some of the more complicated languages and tools.

## Languages, Libraries & Frameworks I've Worked With ##

  * HTML
  * CSS
  * Javascript
  * jQuery
  * AngularJS
  * Twitter Bootstrap
  * Jekyll
  * Ruby
  * Ruby on Rails

## What Makes Me... Me ##

When I'm not programming I'm usually out playing golf or working on my next beer recipe. I'm a huge baseball fan as well and play whenever I get the chance, I love traveling, and I try (but usually fail) to take great photos.
